        <p class="lead mb-4">I have maintained perfect experiences throughout three years of working with an entertainment park company. Itâ€™s a pretty big one, Seaworld Parks & Entertainment. This company owns theme parks all over the world including Seaworld , Sesame Place and Busch Gardens. I think that one of the main skills that benefited me in the long run is learning how to merchandise as I would continue in that field for the next 3 years. While working here I merchandised and interacted with hundreds of guests. I learned how to work courteously and efficiently. I also gained experience in cash handling and working with cash registers. During my time at this job I worked in two different positions, merchandise associate and stadium sales ambassador.While working in stadium sales we had a daily criteria amount to reach and I was always one to meet the mandatory goal and most times exceeding. <br><br>

        Though working with an amusement park was amazing, I still found myself working with busy crowds and customers from all over the world. For all of my jobs, they've been located in a tourist destination that is Sunny San Diego California. I started working at a mall for a pretty touch company, I worked for Crocs Inc. I found this job so much fun as I got to organize by size, color and type along with restocking everything. I love to keep things organized so this was the perfect job for me. Even though I had previous experience in a similar role, working here was a different experience. I had different criteria to meet and was assigned specific roles every shift but these roles were cycled around to the few of us working there. Some days I would only restock, other days I would just greet everyone who walked in and on alternate days I would restock and organize charms.
<br><br>

        Though most of my jobs were under merchandising I found myself working somewhere in a different environment, food and dining. I gained a job a Epic Wings, there are not too many around the world but it was named differently before the renovation, it went under the name epic wings n things. Given the fact that I was in San Diego at the time, that specific restaurant is extremely popular and has so many locations that it is a convenient place for everyone to grab some good food. I was working as a Front of House Ambassador. At this job it was extremely important to maintain a clean workspace as well as all of my other recent jobs. Taking the most precaution in safety guidelines was an extremely important part. At this job I learned how to waitress, this helped me gain a way bigger scale and deeper understanding of customer service. Some jobs I had in this position were double checking the bagged orders to make sure everything is right and as requested, make and wrap utensils , and take orders through the phone, in person and online. I learned how to work in fast paced environments due to this place being so popular.
